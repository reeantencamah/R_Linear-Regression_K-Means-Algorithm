# R_Linear Regression and K-Means Algorithm
Bi and Big Data Analytics, sparkR, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques 

The project's aim is of applying a supervised and an unsupervised machine learning technique on a dataset to test different models/scenario, interpret the results, perform predictions for each model and visualised the results.

-Linear Regression and K-Means Algorithm are used to analyse the Lung Capacity dataset.
- The sourcecode and documentation is available.
- Also can view the video to get an overview explanation of the project.
